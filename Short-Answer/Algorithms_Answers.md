#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 


b) n^2 because there's a loop nested in a loop.


c) o(n) worst case because it will decrement from the number `bunnies` begins at all the way to 0. this recursive code works similar to a loop that counts down, which is also o(n)

## Exercise II

This is a good use case for binary search. The floors are sorted in ascending order. Looping and checking each floor would be too slow o(n).
